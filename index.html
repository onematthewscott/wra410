    <p class="experience">
        I founded a Web Design Studio my freshman year of college in which we build portfolios for students. Our largest client base is at Wayne State University, where we serve 7-12 beautifully designed web portfolios a month. With this, I've been able to develop fluency in HTML/CSS/JS and popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue.Js, and more. I'm currently familiarizing myself with the TailwindCSS framework as I find it quite useful in handling styles much more efficiently. I plan on pursing a career in Frontend Software Engineering.

        I'm interested in how databases & APIs are deconstructed in this class.
